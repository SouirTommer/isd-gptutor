Run only tests that reach or related to the modified statements/modules \n\nWhat are the test cases in WordPad?\n7\n\nWhat are the test cases in GPTutor?\n8\n•What can the user input in this textbox?\n•What is the expected output for the different types of input?\n•What are the challenges in testing an application based on LLM?\nExercise\nThink of the different types of test cases we may need to handle. \nFor each type of test case, define the expected response of the chatbot. Does it meet your expectation?\n\nComplete testing is impossible\n9\n•Testing everything (all combinations of  input and preconditions) is not feasible except in trivial \ncases.\n•The number of  possible inputs is very large.\n•The number of  possible outputs is very large.\n•The number of  paths through the software is very large.\n•The software specification is subjective. You might say that a bug is in the eye of  the beholder.\nInstead of running all the test cases, we select only the most \nrepresentative test cases to test the program!\n\nTest Coverage\n10\n\nWhite box vs. Black box testing\n11\nBlack-box testing \n•Aka specification testing\n•Test case generation are based solely \non the knowledge of  the system \nrequirements.\n•Ensures that specified features of  the \nsoftware are addressed by some \naspect of  the program\nWhite-box testing\n•Aka Code-based testing \n•Test data selection is guided by \ninformation derived from the internal \nstructure and internal functional \nproperties of  the program\n\nTest Coverage\n12\n•Helps answer the following questions\n•Is your software tested sufficiently?\n•In what software component you haven’t tested sufficiently?\n•Black box coverage criterion \n•Requirements coverage: #

The assertion has an overloaded version for float inputs.\n•assertSame(Object expected, Object actual): This assertion passes if  the expected and actual values \nrefer to the same object in memory; otherwise, the assertion fails.\n•assertTrue(Boolean condition): This assertion passes if  the condition is true; otherwise, it fails.\n49\n\nJUnit example\n//incorrect

having to deal with the fragility of  the UI\n•Not most precise\n•Telling you something is broken, they can’t always tell you exactly where.\n\nUser Interface (UI) Tests\n•Generates user interface events (e.g. keystrokes, mouse clicks), and observes the \nchanges that result in the user interface\n•Test the application from the UI layer down.\n\nSelenium\n60\n•Selenium is a popular framework for testing web applications\n•Provides a rich set of  commands for fully testing your web-app\n•Test the existence of  UI elements based on their HTML tags\n•Test for specific content, test for broken links, input fields, selection list options, submitting forms, and table \ndata\n•Testing of  window size, mouse position, alerts, Ajax functionality, pop up windows, event handling,  etc.\nhttps://www.selenium.dev\n\nInstalling Selenium Chrome Extension\n61\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selenium-ide/mooikfkahbdckldjjndioackbalphokd?hl=en\n\nExample\n62\nExport as JUnit Tests\n\nUser Interface Test: Advantages\n•Automation is always feasible \n•End-to-end\n•exercising all the different parts of  the application\n•the user interface, the underlying services, all the way to the database. \n•Often used for high-level smoke tests.\n•super high-level tests that verify that at some basic level our system is up and running\n•Check that the applications are correctly deployed, correctly configured, all the pieces of  our \narchitecture are connected and hooked up right\n\nUser Interface Test: Limitations\n•Slow\n•orders of  magnitude slower than unit tests.\n•UI test may be fragile\n•broken when there are changes in UI\n•Not very precise\n\nAdvantages of  automated testing\n65\n•Fast\n•Automated Tools run tests significantly faster \nthan human users\n•Good for load testing, massive random testing,  \netc\n•Reliable\n•Tests perform precisely the same operations \neach time they are run, thereby eliminating \nhuman error \n•Repeatable\n•You can test how the software reacts under \nrepeated execution of  the same operations. \n\nClimbing the Pyramid\n•Start with Unit Test\n•Step Up to the Integration Tests\n•Reach for the UI Tests\n\nStart with Unit test\n•Most teams start with unit tests because unit tests are what developers write \nevery time they add a feature to the system.\n•The tests are cheap, so we don’t have to do as much later near the top.\n“Test as much of this as you reasonably can, but \nunderstand that you won’t get it all.”\n\nStep Up to the Integration Tests\n•Looking for gaps and high-level connectivity.\n•Do the web requests flow down to the database? \n•Is the authentication service correctly connected to the login code?\n•In web applications, integration test may focus onthe testing of  our web services, \nwhile unit testing will be the testing of  the underlying objects.\n\nReach for the UI Tests\n•Check for end-to-end system confirmation and connectivity with the \nUI.\n•Push as much testing as you possibly can further down the pyramid\n•the tests are faster, more reliable, and less flaky.\n\nPerformance Testing\n•LoadTesting\n•Stress Testing\n•SoakTesting\n70\n\nLoad Testing\n71\n•Performance tests under anticipated production load (normal and peak load conditions)\n•Objectives\n•To determine the response times for various time critical transactions and business processes \n•Helps to identify the maximum operating capacity of  an application as well as any bottlenecks that \nmight interfere with its operating at capacity \n•Ensure that the response times are

      "summary": "Software testing is a systematic investigation aimed at providing stakeholders with insights into the quality of a product or service. It is essential for ensuring that software meets user needs and conforms to requirements, ultimately resulting in customer satisfaction and willingness to pay.\n\nThe V Model illustrates the relationship between development and testing phases, emphasizing the importance of both verification (building the product correctly) and validation (building the correct product). Different types of testing, including unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing, are conducted at various stages, with responsibilities divided among developers and QA engineers.\n\nTesting methodologies can be classified into confirmation testing—where previous failures are retested to ensure fixes—and regression testing, which checks for misbehavior in previously correct functions after modifications. Effective regression strategies can include running all test cases, automating tests, or selectively retesting relevant features.\n\nComplete testing is impractical due to the vast number of potential inputs, outputs, and paths through software. Therefore, only representative test cases are selected for testing. The concept of test coverage is critical, with black-box testing focusing on external requirements and white-box testing examining internal structures. Coverage criteria such as requirements coverage, statement coverage, and decision coverage help assess the sufficiency of testing.\n\nFor example, in a scenario involving user input validation, each requirement should be covered by at least one test case to ensure thorough assessment. Additionally, concepts like condition coverage and multiple condition coverage enhance testing effectiveness by ensuring all logical branches and conditions are evaluated.\n\nIn conclusion, software testing is a multifaceted process integral to delivering high-quality software, requiring strategic planning and execution to address the complexities inherent in software development.",

      "summary": "The provided text consists of two main sections: a disclaimer of liability related to a website and a detailed explanation of various data compression techniques, specifically Huffman coding, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression.\n\nThe disclaimer emphasizes that the information on the website is for general purposes only, and users should not rely on it for making important decisions in academic, business, or legal contexts. It specifies that any use of the content for public or non-private purposes is prohibited and that ZHANG Wengyu disclaims any liability for inaccuracies or technical issues related to the website. Users are warned that external links lead to sites that ZHANG Wengyu does not control, and thus, they bear no responsibility for the content found there.\n\nThe second part discusses data compression methods, starting with Huffman coding. It explains the calculation of entropy for a set of gray-level intensity values and the process of constructing a Huffman tree to encode these values, resulting in specific binary codes for each intensity. The average number of bits required per pixel is calculated based on the Huffman codes.\n\nNext, the DCT section addresses how the transformation of an 8x8 grayscale image can yield specific matrix values, particularly when the input is a uniformly white image. It notes that subtracting 128 from each pixel minimally affects high-frequency coefficients in the DCT matrix.\n\nLastly, the LZW compression algorithm is illustrated through a binary string example. It describes the construction of dictionaries for both compression and decompression stages and calculates the compression rate based on the original and compressed string lengths.\n\nOverall, the text covers important disclaimers regarding information use and provides a comprehensive overview of various data compression techniques, along with practical examples and calculations.",

      "summary": "The report titled \"Re-design the HKeMobility App\" by Group 33 presents a comprehensive analysis and redesign of the HKeMobility app, which is developed by the Transport Department of Hong Kong to facilitate navigation through the city's complex transportation network. The app provides real-time updates on public transport, road conditions, and multi-modal route planning to assist both residents and tourists.\n\nThe report includes a thorough case study with various sections outlining the app's features and functionality such as real-time traffic updates, multi-modal transport information, interactive map navigation, congestion information, and a location search feature. Each feature is designed to enhance user experience by providing accessible and timely information.\n\nA significant portion of the report is dedicated to comparing the original and redesigned interfaces of the app. The analysis identifies critical issues with the original app, including a cluttered interface, poor information hierarchy, inefficient navigation functionality, and insufficient user feedback mechanisms. The redesigned version addresses these problems with improvements such as a more organized home screen, clearer public transport and route selection options, optimized search functionality, and an enhanced map view that reduces visual clutter.\n\nTesting methods, including user tests and feedback summaries, were employed to validate the redesign, while the report concludes with a summary of the testing results and the overall effectiveness of the redesign in improving usability. The findings emphasize the importance of user-centered design in creating intuitive applications that facilitate better navigation and accessibility for users in Hong Kong's transportation landscape.",

Polling\n8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdfcR-8hEY\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nWhat is Ethics?\n•Ethics is a branch of philosophy, an academic subject \nconcerned with the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, \nand existence.\n•Ethics considers people’s values and sources.\n•Consider how people and groups translate those values into \nbehaviorin different over time and place\n•Some values that philosophers consider include justice, \nequality, and human rights.\n•Ethics as “the philosophical study of morality(道德)”\n9\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nWhat is Ethics?\n•Ethics is founded in a society’s moral code \n–the rules (conventions) by which a society lives (an established  \nconsensus)\n–but there are conflicts...\n•Moral code depends on personal background\n–age group, ethnic and cultural background, religion, gender,...\n–E.g. “Should I put Grandma into a retirement home?”\n–E.g. “Should I buy/manufacture/distribute pirated software?”\n10\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nWhere Do Ethics and Values Come From?\n•Philosophers called objectivistssee the ethics project as identifying\nthe right thing to do or the right action to take morally.\n•Divine Command theory(神聖命令理論) proceeds from the \nassumption that a God who exists provides an objective set of \nethical standardsand that humans can behave ethically.\n•Plato’s Theory of Forms –which suggests that we have an ideal \n“something” in mind and that we can then compare a particular \nexperience to that ideal.\n•A moral relativist believes that there is no one absolute right or \nwrong position.\n•Not everyone will see a moral problem in the same way.\n11\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nWhere Do Ethics and Values Come From?\n12\n•Ethicists also disagree about whether ethical values change over time. \n•Moral relativists argue that as technologies advance, ethical values \ncan change too. \n•For example, they argue that many people today enjoy sharing on social \nmedia, and therefore, people don’t value privacy the same way they did \nin the past.\n•Objectivistsargue that ethical decisions rest on stable core values, \nregardless of one’s environment\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nDefinition of Computer Ethics (I)\n•Maner’sdefinition: examines “ethical problems aggravated, \ntransformed or created by computer technology”\n•Johnson’s Definition: ethics studies the way in which computers “pose \nnew versions of standard moral problems and moral dilemmas, \nexacerbating (worsen) the old problems, and forcing us to apply \nordinary moral norms in uncharted realms (unexplored area).” \n•Gotterbarn’sDefinition: a branch of professional ethics, concerned \nprimarily with standards of good practice and codes of conduct for \ncomputing professionals\n13\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nDefinition of Computer Ethics (II)\n•Moor’s Definition: a field concerned with “policy vacuums” and \n“conceptual muddles (confusion)” regarding the social and ethical use of \ninformation technology. \n–Analysis of the nature and social impact of computer technology and the \ncorresponding formulation and justification of policies for the ethical use of such \ntechnology\n•independent of any specific philosopher’s theory\n•compatible with a wide variety of approaches to ethical problem-solving\n•Bynum’s Definition:identifies and analyzes the impacts of information \ntechnology on such social and human values as health, wealth, work, \nopportunity, freedom, democracy, knowledge, privacy, security, self-\nfulfillment, etc. \n–Employs applied ethics, sociology of computing, technology assessment, \ncomputer law, and related fields. \n14\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nHistory of Computer Ethics (1940s –1970s)\n15\nhttps://www.edrawmax.com/templates/1000890/\nfuture of “ubiquitous computing”

that computers allowed humans to go beyond their \nprevious human abilities to do things that previously would have \nbeen impossible. -> a novel problem or policy vacuum emerges  \n\n© 2024 Lotto

Design\n•User-centered design refers to a design process centered explicitly around the \nneeds and experiences of a product’s users.\n•User-centered design can be implemented in designing both user interfaces \nand user experiences.\n•The designer might think about those who will use a product –including \ntechnology-phobic users, older users, those with a disability involving motor \nskills, or those who are visually or hearing impaired.\n•E.g., someone who uses a phone to call for help after an accident might be \nfrightened and unable to focus quickly\n•One of the goals of user-centered design is to identify those who might be \nmarginalized or excluded from using technologies as they exist in their \npresent form.\n18\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nCybersecurity Scenarios Which Present Competing Goals\n19\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nThe Relationship Between Ethics and Religion\n•Ethical arguments establish standards of behavior and practice and \nprovide a basis for describing the moral violations of individual or group.\n•Ethics requires accountability. Example, who are religious and \naccountable to God.\n•World’s major religions are including Buddhism, Confucianism, Judaism, \nIslam, and Christianity.\n•We can also identify ethics based on the values of a community, \nincluding profession such as environmentalist community, military \nmembers, etc.\n20\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nThe Relationship Between Ethics and Law\n•I obey the laws, you might think, why should I think about ethics?\n•Unethical information technology use as: the willful violation –by any individual, \ngroup, or organization –of privacy and property and access and accuracy –\nconcerning information / information goods resident within or part of an \ninformation system, owned / controlled by any other individual group of the \norganization.\n•Act as unethicalif it breaks the rulesor causes harm to others\n•Conventional morality are often codified into laws.\n•Whether law precedes ethics or ethics precedes laws appears in current debates \nabout the foundation of ethics in cyberspace (chicken or egg problem).\n•One difference between a profession and a mere job is that professionals often \nwork independently, without supervision. They need to think critically when the \nrules are unclear or ambiguous, or when more than one rule applies.\n21\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nIndustrial Legal Requirements\n22\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\n❑HKSAR

      "summary": "The lecture by Lotto Lai, titled \"Legal Aspects, Professionalism and Ethics of Computing,\" explores the intersection of ethics, values, and computer technology within a legal framework. It begins with a definition of ethics as a philosophical study of morality, emphasizing how societal moral codes, shaped by personal backgrounds such as age, culture, and religion, influence ethical decisions. Philosophical perspectives, including objectivism and moral relativism, are discussed, highlighting differing views on the stability and evolution of ethical values over time and with technological advancements.\n\nComputer ethics, specifically, is defined through various scholars' lenses, including Maner’s focus on ethical problems exacerbated by technology and Moor’s attention to the social impacts of computing. The evolution of computer ethics from the 1940s to the present is traced, noting how technological advancements have created unique ethical dilemmas and policy vacuums.\n\nUser-centered design is highlighted as a critical approach that prioritizes the needs of diverse users, including marginalized groups, ensuring technology accessibility. The relationship between ethics and religion is examined, noting that ethical standards often derive from religious teachings or community values, while the connection between ethics and law is scrutinized. Ethical behavior is positioned as essential in technology use, especially concerning privacy and property rights, and the debate on whether law or ethics should precede the other in guiding behavior is presented.\n\nFinally, the discussion touches on industrial legal requirements, emphasizing the importance of adhering to regulations while navigating the complexities of ethical decision-making in computing. Overall, Lai’s lecture provides a comprehensive overview of how ethics, legality, and professionalism intertwine in the context of modern computing.",

      "summary": "The presentation by Lotto Lai focuses on the essential aspects of Intellectual Property (IP) management, particularly within the context of Hong Kong, China, and the United States. It provides a comprehensive exploration of various types of IP, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, along with their respective protection mechanisms.\n\nIntellectual Property is defined as a collection of rights protecting creations, inventions, and distinctive signs. Key categories include patents, which safeguard new inventions and processes; copyrights, which protect original expressions of ideas; trademarks, which distinguish products and services; and trade secrets, which encompass confidential information that provides competitive advantages.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the patent system has evolved, particularly after the enactment of the Patents Ordinance in 1997, which introduced two types of patents: Standard Patents and Short-term Patents, offering protection for 20 years and 8 years, respectively. A significant change occurred in December 2019 with the introduction of the original grant patent system, allowing for direct patent applications in Hong Kong without prior applications in designated patent offices.\n\nThe presentation highlights the importance of disclosing inventions and designs to relevant offices before public disclosure to maintain patent validity and novelty. It also emphasizes the distinctiveness of trademarks and the necessity of registration for stronger legal protection, alongside discussing the enduring nature of trade secrets, which remain protected as long as they are kept confidential.\n\nOverall, the lecture underscores the importance of understanding IP management and compliance with standards, such as ISO 56005, to effectively safeguard intellectual assets and foster innovation in a competitive environment.",

It is recommended that \na written notification should be given instead of an oral one.\n•Employers are reminded that such notification does not confer upon them a legal \nright to adopt employee monitoring under all circumstances nor does it release \nthem from their obligations under the Ordinance to observe the six data protection \nprinciples.\n15\n\n©  2024 Lotto Lai\nc) Use and Retention of Video Records\n•Employers must ensure that video records are only used for the purposes stated in \nthe notification given to domestic helpers or a directly related purpose, unless \notherwise permitted by law.\n•It is recommended that video records which contain the personal data of domestic \nhelpers be retained for not more than 7 days. \n•A longer retention period may be considered if the recorded data are required for \nevidentiary purposes (e.g. to assist an investigation conducted by the Privacy \nCommissioner or the police).\n16\n\n©  2024 Lotto Lai\nFacial Recognition and CCTV Surveillance\n17\nhttps://www.hk-lawyer.org/content/facial-recognition-and-cctv-surveillance\n\n©  2024 Lotto Lai\nBackground\n•The complainant was photographed on a street by a photographer working for \nEastweekmagazine (“Eastweek”). \n•The complainant’s photograph, together with some other women being \nphotographed, was published in an article in Eastweekwith unflattering and \nnegative comments about her fashion style. \n•The photograph was taken and published without the complainant’s knowledge \nor consent.\n•The Privacy Commissioner initially found that there was a breach of DPP1(2)(b) \non the part of Eastweekin collecting the complainant’s personal data by an \nunfair means. Eastweekapplied for a judicial review of the Privacy \nCommissioner’s decision, the application for which was dismissed by the Court \nof First Instance. \n•Eastweekfurther appealed to the Court of Appeal against the dismissal of the \njudicial review application and the appeal was allowed.\n18\n\n©  2024 Lotto Lai\nCollecting Personal Data and Relevance of Identity\n•The Court held that in the act of personal data collection, the data user must be \ncompiling information about an identified person or about a person whom the \ndata user intends to or seeks to identify. \n•What was crucial in the case was the complainant’s anonymity and the irrelevance \nof her identity to the photographer, the reporter and Eastweek. \n•The Court held that taking photograph of the complainant in the circumstances of \nthe case did not constitute an act of collection of personal dataof the complainant.\n•The Court stressed that the press or other media organisationsdo not fall outside \nthe scope of the PDPO. If an organization engages in collecting personal data, the \nprovisions of the PDPO squarely apply.\n•The Court further emphasized that while the complainant would be entirely justified \nin regarding the article and the photograph.\n19\n\n©  2024 Lotto Lai\nImplications in the Digital Era\n•If a person’s image is captured by AI installed in the CCTV system with intent to \nascertain his identity, this may constitute collection of personal data, presumably by \nthe operator of the CCTV system in the first place.\n•When footage in a CCTV system is being used to ascertain the identities of \nindividuals by automated means, it would amount to collection of personal data of \nindividuals, necessitating the application of the PDPO including the notification \nrequirement under DPP1(Collection Purpose & Means) and the limitation of use \nrequirement under DPP3 (Use), ... etc. \n•It advises operators of such CCTV systems to conduct a privacy impact assessment.\n•For details, please refer to “Guidance on CCTV Surveillance and Use of Drones”\n20\n\n©  2024 Lotto Lai\nComputer Related Crimes (HK cases)\n21\nhttps://cyberdefender.hk/en-us/statistics/\n\n©  2024 Lotto Lai\nOverall Technology Crime Figures\n22\n\n©  2024 Lotto Lai\nE-shopping Fraud\n23\nMost reports centre on sales of items such as handbags, concert tickets, travel packages and electronics\n•It is a form of cybercrime that occurs with online customer transactions. \n\n©  2024 Lotto Lai\n24\nhttps://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3232025/more-230-hongkongers-\nscammed-through-online-shopping-travel-or-hotel-deals-single-week-august-policeD\nhttps://www.adcc.gov.hk/en-hk/alerts.html\n\n©  2024 Lotto Lai\nEmail Scam\n25\n•It is a malicious email that aim to trick recipients into giving up their sensitive \ninformation, such as bank accounts and passwords.\n\n©  2024 Lotto Lai\n26\nhttps://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3248544/hong-kong-police-\ninvestigate-email-scam-following-german-pharmaceutical-firms-report-it-was-swindled\nhttps://www.adcc.gov.hk/en-hk/alerts.html\n\n©  2024 Lotto Lai\nTheft of Online Account\n27\n•It is a crime in which an attacker uses fraud or deception to obtain personal or \nsensitive information from a victim and misuses it to act in the victim's name.\n\n©  2024 Lotto Lai\n28\nhttps://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3240097/scammers-steal-\nhk100-million-hong-kong-residents-single-week-fake-investment-platforms-police-reveal\nhttps://www.adcc.gov.hk/en-hk/alerts.html\n\n©  2024 Lotto Lai\nSocial media scam\n29\n•People requesting you as a friend and asking for money.

Polling\n8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdfcR-8hEY\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nWhat is Ethics?\n•Ethics is a branch of philosophy, an academic subject \nconcerned with the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, \nand existence.\n•Ethics considers people’s values and sources.\n•Consider how people and groups translate those values into \nbehaviorin different over time and place\n•Some values that philosophers consider include justice, \nequality, and human rights.\n•Ethics as “the philosophical study of morality(道德)”\n9\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nWhat is Ethics?\n•Ethics is founded in a society’s moral code \n–the rules (conventions) by which a society lives (an established  \nconsensus)\n–but there are conflicts...\n•Moral code depends on personal background\n–age group, ethnic and cultural background, religion, gender,...\n–E.g. “Should I put Grandma into a retirement home?”\n–E.g. “Should I buy/manufacture/distribute pirated software?”\n10\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nWhere Do Ethics and Values Come From?\n•Philosophers called objectivistssee the ethics project as identifying\nthe right thing to do or the right action to take morally.\n•Divine Command theory(神聖命令理論) proceeds from the \nassumption that a God who exists provides an objective set of \nethical standardsand that humans can behave ethically.\n•Plato’s Theory of Forms –which suggests that we have an ideal \n“something” in mind and that we can then compare a particular \nexperience to that ideal.\n•A moral relativist believes that there is no one absolute right or \nwrong position.\n•Not everyone will see a moral problem in the same way.\n11\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nWhere Do Ethics and Values Come From?\n12\n•Ethicists also disagree about whether ethical values change over time. \n•Moral relativists argue that as technologies advance, ethical values \ncan change too. \n•For example, they argue that many people today enjoy sharing on social \nmedia, and therefore, people don’t value privacy the same way they did \nin the past.\n•Objectivistsargue that ethical decisions rest on stable core values, \nregardless of one’s environment\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nDefinition of Computer Ethics (I)\n•Maner’sdefinition: examines “ethical problems aggravated, \ntransformed or created by computer technology”\n•Johnson’s Definition: ethics studies the way in which computers “pose \nnew versions of standard moral problems and moral dilemmas, \nexacerbating (worsen) the old problems, and forcing us to apply \nordinary moral norms in uncharted realms (unexplored area).” \n•Gotterbarn’sDefinition: a branch of professional ethics, concerned \nprimarily with standards of good practice and codes of conduct for \ncomputing professionals\n13\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nDefinition of Computer Ethics (II)\n•Moor’s Definition: a field concerned with “policy vacuums” and \n“conceptual muddles (confusion)” regarding the social and ethical use of \ninformation technology. \n–Analysis of the nature and social impact of computer technology and the \ncorresponding formulation and justification of policies for the ethical use of such \ntechnology\n•independent of any specific philosopher’s theory\n•compatible with a wide variety of approaches to ethical problem-solving\n•Bynum’s Definition:identifies and analyzes the impacts of information \ntechnology on such social and human values as health, wealth, work, \nopportunity, freedom, democracy, knowledge, privacy, security, self-\nfulfillment, etc. \n–Employs applied ethics, sociology of computing, technology assessment, \ncomputer law, and related fields. \n14\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nHistory of Computer Ethics (1940s –1970s)\n15\nhttps://www.edrawmax.com/templates/1000890/\nfuture of “ubiquitous computing”

that computers allowed humans to go beyond their \nprevious human abilities to do things that previously would have \nbeen impossible. -> a novel problem or policy vacuum emerges  \n\n© 2024 Lotto

Design\n•User-centered design refers to a design process centered explicitly around the \nneeds and experiences of a product’s users.\n•User-centered design can be implemented in designing both user interfaces \nand user experiences.\n•The designer might think about those who will use a product –including \ntechnology-phobic users, older users, those with a disability involving motor \nskills, or those who are visually or hearing impaired.\n•E.g., someone who uses a phone to call for help after an accident might be \nfrightened and unable to focus quickly\n•One of the goals of user-centered design is to identify those who might be \nmarginalized or excluded from using technologies as they exist in their \npresent form.\n18\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nCybersecurity Scenarios Which Present Competing Goals\n19\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nThe Relationship Between Ethics and Religion\n•Ethical arguments establish standards of behavior and practice and \nprovide a basis for describing the moral violations of individual or group.\n•Ethics requires accountability. Example, who are religious and \naccountable to God.\n•World’s major religions are including Buddhism, Confucianism, Judaism, \nIslam, and Christianity.\n•We can also identify ethics based on the values of a community, \nincluding profession such as environmentalist community, military \nmembers, etc.\n20\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nThe Relationship Between Ethics and Law\n•I obey the laws, you might think, why should I think about ethics?\n•Unethical information technology use as: the willful violation –by any individual, \ngroup, or organization –of privacy and property and access and accuracy –\nconcerning information / information goods resident within or part of an \ninformation system, owned / controlled by any other individual group of the \norganization.\n•Act as unethicalif it breaks the rulesor causes harm to others\n•Conventional morality are often codified into laws.\n•Whether law precedes ethics or ethics precedes laws appears in current debates \nabout the foundation of ethics in cyberspace (chicken or egg problem).\n•One difference between a profession and a mere job is that professionals often \nwork independently, without supervision. They need to think critically when the \nrules are unclear or ambiguous, or when more than one rule applies.\n21\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\nIndustrial Legal Requirements\n22\n\n© 2024 Lotto Lai\n❑HKSAR

      "summary": "The lecture by Lotto Lai on the \"Legal Aspects, Professionalism, and Ethics of Computing\" introduces key concepts surrounding ethics, particularly computer ethics, and their implications in the context of technology. Ethics, defined as a branch of philosophy concerning morality, involves the study of values, justice, equality, and human rights, shaped by societal moral codes which can differ based on personal backgrounds, including age, culture, and religion.\n\nThe lecture delves into the origins of ethics and values, contrasting objectivist beliefs that propose a singular moral truth with relativist perspectives suggesting that ethical standards evolve with societal changes and technological advances. Computer ethics is defined through several scholars, highlighting the unique ethical dilemmas arising from technology, which can exacerbate traditional moral issues and necessitate the application of established norms to new contexts.\n\nThe evolution of computer ethics is traced historically from the 1940s to the present, illustrating how technological advancements have continually introduced new ethical challenges. User-centered design is emphasized as a crucial component of ethical technology development, focusing on the needs and experiences of diverse users, including marginalized groups.\n\nThe relationship between ethics and religion is explored, noting how ethical standards often correlate with religious values and community norms. Additionally, the interplay between ethics and law is discussed, underscoring that while laws dictate acceptable behavior, they may not encompass all ethical considerations, particularly in complex technological scenarios. The lecture concludes with an overview of industrial legal requirements, stressing the importance of accountability in the ethical use of information technology. Overall, Lai's presentation serves as a foundational introduction to understanding the critical intersection of ethics, computing, and society.",

They must avoid misrepresenting their qualifications and must not engage in dishonest practices.\n\n2. **Social Implications**: Members should be aware of the broader impact of their work, including adherence to laws and standards, respect for intellectual property, and a commitment to human rights. They must avoid discrimination and promote the well-being of society while respecting confidentiality.\n\n3. **Organization and Leadership**: Members are expected to promote professional development within their teams, manage resources responsibly, and maintain effective communication. They must respect client confidentiality and avoid conflicts of interest, while also ensuring that user needs are addressed in system design.\n\n4. **Duty to the Profession**: Members should strive to enhance the profession's reputation, contribute to public understanding of computing, and support fellow members. They should act with integrity, make qualified public statements, and refrain from undermining others' reputations.\n\nOverall, the HKCS Code of Ethics sets a comprehensive standard for professional behavior that emphasizes integrity, social responsibility, and a commitment to continuous learning within the IT field.",

      "summary": "The text provides a comprehensive overview of Intellectual Property (IP) management, including its types, protection mechanisms, and the patent systems in Hong Kong and China, along with a comparison to the USA. \n\nIntellectual Property encompasses rights related to creations such as products, processes, artistic works, and business ideas, primarily categorized into copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. Copyright protects original expressions of ideas, while patents grant monopoly rights for new inventions that must be novel, involve an inventive step, and be useful. Trademarks serve to distinguish products or services from others, and trade secrets consist of confidential information that provides competitive advantages.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the patent system underwent significant changes with the enactment of the Patents Ordinance in 1997, introducing two types of patents: Standard Patents with a maximum protection term of 20 years and Short-term Patents lasting 8 years. A notable update occurred on December 19, 2019, allowing direct filing of Standard Patent applications in Hong Kong through an Original Grant Patent system. Prior to this, patents had to be registered based on applications from designated patent offices such as the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) or the European Patent Office (EPO).\n\nOverall, the text emphasizes the importance of IP management standards, specifically ISO 56005, in formulating effective IP strategies and ensuring the protection of intellectual assets. Understanding the nuances of IP regulations is critical for businesses and individuals looking to safeguard their innovations and creative expressions.",
